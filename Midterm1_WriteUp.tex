\begin{abstract}
This project was to create an application that used the CoreLocation framework to track
and record the users location.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The primary purpose of this tutorial was to gain experience using the CoreLocation
framework by creating an application that tracks and logs the users location. As an
extention of this primary purpose, the tutorial also offered a number of other opportunities
to learn about various frameworks and aspects of swift as well as experience in storyboarding
and working in Xcode. Through the app design process we were able to learn more about
table views using the UIKit table view controller feature. Using MapKit, we 
learned how to embed a map into the application as well as add custom points of 
interest to it. Another useful feature we gained experience with was the Codable
protocal, which provides an easy way to allow the app data to be encoded and decoded
for storage. We also learned how to use various features of the CoreLocation 
framework such as CLLocationCoordinate2D.

On top of the features included in the original tutorial, we also added in a few 
addition functions that work with the Yelp Fusion API and are applicable towards 
the application we will be developing for the final project. Adding in these features
provided us with the opportunity to gain an understanding of working with APIs and
using other frameworks and functions within Swift and Xcode that will be beneficial
to us when creating our final application.

\section{Functionality}
For this project, our application function was divided into two main portions:
the functions that came from the tutorial we chose and the functions that we decided
to add into the app. Both of these are discussed in detail below.

As a whole, we tried to develop our app using the principles of Model-View-Controller 
(MVC). The way we accomplished this was by dividing our program in such a way that 
all of the data storage and structures (the Model) are only accessed by the view
controllers (the Controller). The view controllers manipulate that data, 
retrieve new data from outside sources such as the Yelp Fusion API, pass things on
for the user to see (in the View), and retrieve input from the user. A simple
chart of how this works for our app is shown as a function diagram in Figure 1
in the References section.

\subsection{Original Function}

\subsubsection{Baseline App}
The first step of the tutorial was to recreate the baseline application that the
tutorial author had given as a download. Since we were not allowed to download
these materials, we had to create our own version to accomplish the same goal.
To create this, we used the information at the beginning of the tutorial as an
outline on what should be included as a starting point. To start, we had to create
a storyboard that included all of the neccesary elements for the app. This meant 
making a TabViewController that split into a TableView and MapView scenes. After 
creating those scenes and the appropriate buttons on them, we had to create 
ViewController files for each to handle the operations that needed to be done within
those scenes. Using the MVC pattern, those ViewControllers handle all of "middle man"
work, accessing any data structures and handling interaction with the user. After
creating the ViewControllers, we needed a way to store the data recieved so we created
a class called Location that holds all the needed data about a users location and
a class called LocationStorage that handles storing the data to the local disk.
Creating the LocationStorage class gave us experience with the FileManager feature
of the Foundation framework that makes it very easy to save and load data.

\subsection{Added Functions}
Overall, our team added three additional features to the application that were not 
originally included in the tutorial. These features focused on adding functionality
that would tie into our final application and that created methods that we could
reuse in our future projects.

\subsubsection{Find Closest Restaurant}
The first additional feature that we added was to allow the user to see the closest
restaurant to them in the map view screen. From a user standpoint, we did this by 
adding a button in the top left of the navigation bar that says "Find Food." When 
pressed, this button will create a pin on the map showing the location of the nearest
restaurant, with the restaurant name and address as the pin's label.

From a coding standpoint, the way that this was implemented took a number of steps.
First, in the main storyboard of the application, we added a navigation bar button
to the top left of the MapView scene named "Find Food". We then linked this button
into the MapViewController.swift file to create an IBAction function called findFood().
Inside of the findFood function, we accomplish several things. The first and 
most significant task is that the function sends a request to the Yelp Fusion API
to recieve a JSON object with a list of all the restaurants close to the users current
application. After retreiving the JSON object, our code then uses the data to populate
a structure named BusinessInfo that holds all of the information retrieved from Yelp
in the same layout as the JSON. Using this structure, the function then calls a seperate
function that loops through the list of businesses and finds out which restaurant
is closest to the user's current location. Once it has this business, the findFood
function then creates a custom pin (defined as another class: CustomPin), and then
adds it to the map as a MapKit annotation.

\section{Challenges}

\subsection{Challenges in Tutorial}


\subsection{Challenges in Additions}
One large hurdle to overcome when making the extra features was figuring out how
to properly call the Yelp Fusion API and retrieve the data from that. It took a 
great deal of research to find out how to correctly use the URLRequest and URLSession
functions to obtain the JSON file from Yelp. After obtaining the file, another large
challenge to overcome was figuring out how to parse the JSON file and use it contents.
We ended up solving this by creating a struct that correlated directly to the contents
of the JSON, and then used the JSONDecoder class to transfer the contents of the 
JSON into a struct.
